title: "How to run **fastqc analysis** in the computational infrastructure of INAB"
execute:
  echo: false
---

## Steps to run the analysis:

### 1. Log in to the appropriate server:

o 160.40.71.4

### 2. Identify where your NGS results (.fastq files) are located:

o e.g., /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research/2025_05_21_ERIC_study

### 3. Move to the your working directory:

``` bash
cd /work/folder_of_each_user
```

### 4. Create a new analysis directory:

``` bash
mkdir fastqc_2025_05_21
```

### 5. Move to the your new analysis directory:

``` bash
cd /work/folder_of_each_user/fastqc_2025_05_21
```

### 6. Download script to your analysis directory

``` bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/RNAseq_analysis/main/bash/fastqc.sh
```

``` bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/RNAseq_analysis/main/bash/runFASTQC.sh 
```

### 7. Create a SampleList

You have to **update** with the right path to your **fastq files**.

``` bash
ls -la /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research/2025_05_21_ERIC_study | awk '{print $9}' | awk -F "_R" '{print $1}' | sort | uniq > SampleList
```

### 8. Remove samples that should not be analyzed:

``` bash
nano SampleList
```

In order to **edit** the SampleList use the following:

o `Delete button`: Removes one letter

o `Ctrl + k`: Removes a whole row

o `Ctrl + o and Enter`: Saves the modified SampleList

o `Ctrl + x`: Exits and returns to the terminal

### 9. Run the analysis:

You have to **update** with the right path.

``` bash
nohup bash runFASTQC.sh /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research/2025_05_21_ERIC_study SampleList 16 &
```

### 10. After the analysis is completed

Move your folder from **/work** to **/mnt/new_home**

``` bash
cd ..
```

``` bash
rsync -r fastqc_2025_05_21 /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research
```
